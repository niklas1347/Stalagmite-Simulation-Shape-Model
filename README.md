# niklas1347-Stalagmite-Simulation-Shape-Model
The Shape Model allows the user to simulate the formation of stalagmites with 4 input parameters: calcium concentration of the water drop, drip interval, cave temperature, and cave carbon-dioxide. The output Parameters are growth rate, equilibrium radius, excessive calcium concentration and the respective depth of the values. The Shape model is used at the example of the So-1 in the Sofular Cave, Turkey in the paper which soon will be puplished. More background information can be found there. If the code is further used for further studies please cite this paper.
